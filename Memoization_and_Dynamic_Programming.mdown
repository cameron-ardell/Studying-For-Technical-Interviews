# Memoization and Dynamic Programming

### Dynamic programming solves smaller versions of a problem, stores intermediate results, and uses these to build next set of intermediate results

### Memoization is a technique where you cache previously computed results, and return cached results when same computation is needed again.

When approaching a problem you think could have have a dynamic programming solution try to first do a recursive approach, then a memoization approach, then a dynamic programming approach.
